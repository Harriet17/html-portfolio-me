<h1>TOP  MOVIE SERIES AND ANIMES OF THE YEAR</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies and series of all- time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.Demon slayer </h3>
<h4>This anime won the heart of many. For a critique female anime watcher, I will totally recommend demon slayer. season 1-3 is currently available although other seasons havent been released yet. </h4>
<h3>2.Arcane</h3>
<h4>This is also an animated series. However,its unique story line of love and hate captivates it readers. Unfortunately only season one is currently out.</h4>
<h3>3.YOU</h3>
<h4>This series you tends to give off deep dark vibes centered around the life of a boy. Boys tend to like it a lot but it may be a little too dark for girls. Thankfully, the movie was saved by it somewhat happy ever after.</h4>
